Given a set of products and a set of price listings matching some of those products. 
The task is to match each listing to the correct product. Precision is critical. 
Missed matches are preferred (lower recall) over incorrect matches, avoiding false positives. 
A single price listing may match at most one product.

The inputs and output are all text files. Each file has one JSON object per line. 
Below describes what those objects look like.


--Products
{
  "product_name": String   // A unique id for the product
  "manufacturer": String
  "family": String         // optional grouping of products
  "model": String
  "announced-date": String // ISO-8601 formatted date string, e.g. 2011-04-28T19:00:00.000-05:00
}

--Listing
{
  "title": String         // description of product for sale
  "manufacturer":  String // who manufactures the product for sale
  "currency": String      // currency code, e.g. USD, CAD, GBP, etc.
  "price": String         // price, e.g. 19.99, 100.00
}

--Result
A file full of Result objects generated. 
A Result simply associates a Product with a list of matching Listing objects.
{
  "product_name": String
  "listings": Array[Listing]
}
